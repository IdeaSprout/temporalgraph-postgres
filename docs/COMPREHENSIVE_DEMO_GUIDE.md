**Demo Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Audience:** Technical stakeholders, potential users, investors

---

## 🚀 Pre-Demo Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Environment Preparation

#### 1.1 Start PostgreSQL Database
```powershell
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running with Apache AGE and pgvector
# Your database should be running on localhost with 'graphdb' database
# Connection string: postgresql://localhost:5432/graphdb
```

#### 1.2 Verify Database Connection
```powershell
# Test connection using your MCP setup
# Verify tables exist: nodes, edges, events in temporal_graph schema
```

### Step 2: Load Demo Data Using MCP

#### 2.1 Create Rich E-commerce Dataset
Let's load a comprehensive dataset that showcases all Graphiti capabilities:

```sql
-- Clear existing data for fresh demo
TRUNCATE TABLE temporal_graph.events CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE temporal_graph.nodes CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE temporal_graph.edges CASCADE;
```

#### 2.2 Load Sample Events (Execute via MCP)

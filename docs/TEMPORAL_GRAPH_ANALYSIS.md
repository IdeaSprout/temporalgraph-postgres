## What is the Temporal Graph?

The **Temporal Graph** is a sophisticated **bi-temporal knowledge graph** that revolutionizes how we understand customer journeys by tracking both:

### Bi-Temporal Data Model
- **Valid Time**: When a fact was actually true in the real world
- **Transaction Time**: When the fact was recorded in your database

**Example:**
- Alice's address changed on Jan 1st (valid time)
- But you recorded this change on Jan 5th (transaction time)

### Core Components

#### TemporalNodes (Entities)
- Customers, products, orders, addresses, etc.
- Each has `valid_from` and `valid_to` timestamps
- Properties stored as JSONB for flexibility
- Vector embeddings for semantic search

#### TemporalEdges (Relationships)
- "customer PURCHASED product"
- "customer LIVES_AT address"
- Also have `valid_from` and `valid_to` timestamps

#### Events
- Raw customer actions (purchase, support request, etc.)
- Trigger the creation/updating of nodes and edges

---

## Episode Grouping Logic

### What Makes Multiple Events Group Into An Episode?

**Primary Rule: Time-based grouping within 1 hour**
- Events are grouped into episodes if they occur within **1 hour** of each other
- The threshold is defined as `episode_threshold = timedelta(hours=1)`

### How the Grouping Works

1. **Sorting**: All events are first sorted by their timestamp in chronological order

2. **Sequential Grouping**: The algorithm processes events one by one:
   - The first event starts a new episode
   - Each subsequent event is compared to the last event in the current episode
   - If the time difference is ‚â§ 1 hour, the event is added to the current episode
   - If the time difference is > 1 hour, the current episode is finalized and a new episode starts

3. **Episode Creation**: When an episode is finalized, it includes:
   - **All events** within the time window
   - **Start time**: timestamp of the first event
   - **End time**: timestamp of the last event
   - **Summary**: description of event types (e.g., "Episode with 3 events: purchase, support_request")

### Example Scenario

Alice Johnson has these events:
```
10:00 AM - purchase (laptop)
10:15 AM - support_request (setup help)
10:30 AM - purchase (accessories)
2:00 PM - support_request (warranty question)
2:15 PM - purchase (extended warranty)
```

This creates **2 episodes**:
- **Episode 1** (10:00-10:30 AM): purchase ‚Üí support_request ‚Üí purchase
- **Episode 2** (2:00-2:15 PM): support_request ‚Üí purchase

The gap between 10:30 AM and 2:00 PM (3.5 hours) exceeds the 1-hour threshold, so they become separate episodes.

## Why Temporal Graphs Are Revolutionary

### 1. Time Travel Analytics üï∞Ô∏è
- See exactly what your system "knew" at any point in time
- Track how customer relationships evolved
- Understand causality: "Did the price change cause the purchase spike?"

### 2. Historical Accuracy üìä
- No data loss - every change is preserved
- Audit trail for compliance
- Can "replay" business decisions with historical context

### 3. Relationship Evolution üîó
- Track when relationships started/ended
- "Alice was a VIP customer from Jan-Mar, then churned"
- Understand patterns: "Support requests often precede cancellations"

### 4. Complex Queries üîç
- "Find customers who were active 6 months ago but are quiet now"
- "What products were trending during the holiday season?"
- "Which support issues led to customer churn?"

### 5. Memory-Like Intelligence üß†
- Your system "remembers" context across time
- Can answer questions like: "Why did Alice's behavior change?"
- Builds a rich, evolving understanding of each customer

### 6. Search Across Time üîé
- Semantic search with temporal filters
- "Find customers similar to Alice's profile from last year"
- Hybrid search combining meaning, keywords, and time

## Comparison with Traditional Approaches

### Traditional Database Problems

#### Static Snapshots üì∏
```sql
-- Traditional approach
UPDATE customers SET status='VIP', tier='Gold' WHERE id='alice';
-- ‚ùå LOST FOREVER: When did Alice become VIP? What was her previous tier?
```

#### No Historical Context üö´
```sql
-- Traditional approach
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE status='VIP';
-- ‚ùå CAN'T ANSWER: "Who were VIPs 6 months ago but churned since?"
-- ‚ùå CAN'T ANSWER: "What caused Alice to become VIP?"
```

### Traditional Graph (Neo4j, etc.) Problems

#### Static Relationships üîó
```cypher
// Traditional graph
CREATE (alice:Customer)-[:PURCHASED]->(laptop:Product)
// ‚ùå MISSING: When? For how long was this relationship valid?
// ‚ùå MISSING: What was Alice's state BEFORE this purchase?
```

### GraphRAG Problems

#### No Temporal Retrieval üîç
```python
# GraphRAG approach
vector_search("customers similar to Alice")
# ‚ùå MISSING: "Customers similar to Alice's profile from LAST YEAR"
# ‚ùå MISSING: "How Alice's behavior CHANGED over time"
```

### Our Temporal Graph Advantages

#### 1. Time Travel Queries ‚è∞
```python
# Your system CAN do this:
graph.query_at_time("customer", datetime(2024, 12, 1))
# Returns: "Alice was 'Standard' tier, had 2 support tickets, $500 lifetime value"

graph.query_at_time("customer", datetime(2025, 6, 1))  
# Returns: "Alice is 'VIP' tier, 0 open tickets, $5000 lifetime value"

# INSIGHT: Alice's transformation from Standard‚ÜíVIP over 6 months!
```

#### 2. Causality Analysis üîÑ
```python
# Your system tracks the SEQUENCE:
# Dec 15: Alice purchases laptop ($1200)
# Dec 16: Support request (setup help) 
# Dec 17: Support resolved positively
# Dec 18: Alice leaves 5-star review
# Dec 20: Alice's tier upgraded to VIP
# Dec 25: Alice purchases accessories ($800)

# INSIGHT: Great support experience ‚Üí VIP upgrade ‚Üí higher purchases
```

#### 3. Relationship Evolution üìà
```python
# Traditional: "Alice bought products X, Y, Z"
# Your system: 
# "Alice's relationship with ProductX: 
#  - Purchased (Dec 2024)
#  - Had issues (Dec 2024-Jan 2025) 
#  - Resolved satisfaction (Jan 2025)
#  - Became advocate/reviewer (Feb 2025)"
```

#### 4. Predictive Temporal Patterns üîÆ
```python
# Your system can identify:
# "Customers who have 2+ support tickets within 30 days 
#  have 60% churn probability in the following 90 days"

# "VIP customers who go 45+ days without purchases
#  typically downgrade within 2 months"
```

### Concrete Business Value Examples

#### Traditional Approach:
‚ùå "Alice is a VIP customer with $5000 lifetime value"

#### Your Temporal Graph:
‚úÖ "Alice started as Standard tier (Dec 2024), had initial product issues requiring 2 support contacts, but after positive resolution became highly engaged, upgraded to VIP (Jan 2025), and now has $5000 LTV with 95% satisfaction trend. **Prediction**: Likely to remain VIP for 12+ months based on similar temporal patterns."

### Real Scenarios Your System Solves

#### 1. Churn Prevention üö®
```python
# Find customers following Alice's early pattern (pre-VIP)
similar_journeys = graph.find_similar_temporal_patterns(
    customer_id="alice", 
    time_period="first_60_days"
)
# Proactively help customers showing early Alice-like issues
```

#### 2. Personalized Marketing üéØ
```python
# "What was Alice interested in 3 months ago vs now?"
interests_then = graph.query_at_time("interests", 3.months.ago)
interests_now = graph.query_at_time("interests", now)
# Send contextual offers based on interest evolution
```

#### 3. Product Development üõ†Ô∏è
```python
# "What product issues emerge 30-60 days after purchase?"
post_purchase_issues = graph.query_temporal_patterns(
    event_sequence=["purchase", "support_request"],
    time_gap=(30, 60, "days")
)
```

### Why GraphRAG Can't Do This

**GraphRAG** is great for **semantic retrieval** but lacks:
- ‚ùå **Temporal reasoning**: "How did this relationship change over time?"
- ‚ùå **Causality tracking**: "What sequence of events led to this outcome?"  
- ‚ùå **Historical context**: "What was true 6 months ago vs now?"
- ‚ùå **Predictive patterns**: "Based on temporal patterns, what happens next?"

## Hybrid Architecture: Temporal + Regular Graphs

### Dual Storage System - Best of Both Worlds! üöÄ

Your system uses **BOTH** temporal and regular graph storage in a smart hybrid approach:

#### Primary: Temporal Graph Storage
```sql
-- Your main temporal storage tables:
temporal_graph.nodes     -- TemporalNodes (customers, products, etc.)
temporal_graph.edges     -- TemporalEdges (relationships with time)
temporal_graph.events    -- Raw events (purchases, support requests, etc.)
```

#### Secondary: Apache AGE (Regular Graph)
```sql
-- Apache AGE tables (regular graph database):
temporal_graph._ag_label_vertex  -- Regular graph vertices
temporal_graph._ag_label_edge    -- Regular graph edges
```

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Raw Event ‚Üí Temporal Processing ‚Üí Dual Storage
    ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Customer       Extract           Store in both:
Action         Entities &        ‚Ä¢ temporal_graph.* 
               Relationships     ‚Ä¢ _ag_label_*
```

### When Each Is Used

#### Temporal Graph Queries:
```python
# Time-based questions
graph.query_at_time("customer", last_month)
graph.get_entity_history("alice_johnson") 
graph.query_in_time_range("purchases", holiday_season)
```

#### Regular Graph Queries:
```sql
-- Traditional graph questions
-- "Find all customers who bought products similar to what Alice bought"
-- "What's the shortest path from Alice to Product X?"
-- "Which customers are most central in the network?"
```

### Why This Hybrid Approach Is Superior üéñÔ∏è

#### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Temporal queries** ‚Üí Use temporal tables (optimized for time ranges)
- **Graph algorithms** ‚Üí Use AGE (optimized for traversals)

#### 2. Query Flexibility
- **"When did this happen?"** ‚Üí Temporal graph
- **"Who is connected to whom?"** ‚Üí Regular graph
- **"How did relationships evolve?"** ‚Üí Temporal graph
- **"Find the shortest path"** ‚Üí Regular graph

#### 3. Best Tool for Each Job
- **Time-series analysis** ‚Üí Temporal storage excels
- **Network analysis** ‚Üí Traditional graph excels
- **Combined insights** ‚Üí Use both together!

### Real Example: Complex Query Using BOTH Systems

```python
# Complex query using BOTH systems:

# 1. Temporal: Find Alice's VIP upgrade time
vip_date = temporal_graph.query("SELECT valid_from FROM nodes 
                                WHERE type='customer' AND properties->>'tier'='VIP'")

# 2. Regular Graph: Find customers with similar network position to Alice
similar_customers = age_graph.query("MATCH (a:Customer)-[:SIMILAR_TO]-(c:Customer) 
                                    WHERE a.name = 'Alice' RETURN c")

# 3. Temporal: Check when those customers became VIP
for customer in similar_customers:
    vip_timeline = temporal_graph.get_entity_history(customer.id)
    # Compare Alice's timeline vs others
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Models

#### TemporalNode
```python
class TemporalNode(Base):
    __tablename__ = "nodes"
    
    id = Column(PG_UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True)
    type = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    properties = Column(JSONB)
    valid_from = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=False)
    valid_to = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))
    recorded_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))
    embedding = Column(Vector(1536))  # For semantic search
```

#### TemporalEdge
```python
class TemporalEdge(Base):
    __tablename__ = "edges"
    
    id = Column(PG_UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True)
    source_node_id = Column(PG_UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey('nodes.id'))
    target_node_id = Column(PG_UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey('nodes.id'))
    relationship_type = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    properties = Column(JSONB)
    valid_from = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=False)
    valid_to = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))
    recorded_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))
```

#### Event
```python
class Event(Base):
    __tablename__ = "events"
    
    id = Column(PG_UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True)
    event_type = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    event_data = Column(JSONB, nullable=False)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=False)
    processed = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))
```

### Key Operations

#### Time Travel Queries
```python
def query_at_time(self, query: str, timestamp: datetime) -> List[TemporalNode]:
    """Query graph state at specific time."""
    nodes = session.query(TemporalNode).filter(
        and_(
            TemporalNode.type == query,
            TemporalNode.valid_from <= timestamp,
            or_(
                TemporalNode.valid_to.is_(None),
                TemporalNode.valid_to > timestamp
            )
        )
    ).all()
    return nodes
```

#### Entity History
```python
def get_entity_history(self, entity_id: str) -> List[Tuple[TemporalNode, TimeRange]]:
    """Get complete history of entity changes."""
    nodes = session.query(TemporalNode).filter(
        TemporalNode.properties['identifier'].astext == entity_id
    ).order_by(TemporalNode.valid_from).all()
    
    history = []
    for node in nodes:
        time_range = TimeRange(node.valid_from, node.valid_to)
        history.append((node, time_range))
    
    return history
```

---

## Conclusion

The temporal graph system represents a paradigm shift from static data storage to **dynamic, time-aware intelligence**. By preserving the full history of customer interactions and relationships, it enables:

1. **Deep Understanding**: See not just what happened, but when, why, and what came next
2. **Predictive Power**: Use historical patterns to predict future behavior
3. **Contextual Intelligence**: Understand the full story behind each customer journey
4. **Business Impact**: Make data-driven decisions based on temporal causality, not just correlations

This system transforms customer analytics from simple reporting to **temporal intelligence** - understanding customers as they evolve through time, not just as static profiles. üöÄ
